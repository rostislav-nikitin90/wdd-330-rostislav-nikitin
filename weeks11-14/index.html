          <p>This exercise involved writing JavaScript code to provide the functionality of a News web application. The purpose of this application is to display, after a user input, a list of news article titles and related images as a link to redirect to the news article using a third party API (https://thenewsapi.com) on the user's html page. 
              The application includes a simple form for the user with one input field and one submit button for the user-entered keyword (news topic) in the input field. After the user has entered a news topic and clicked the submit button, the application should display a list of the news article titles and associated images for the search-specific news topic as a link to redirect to the news article using a third-party API. 
              The news list is displayed as an unordered list in the output inside a div element on the user's html page. The user is able to click on the link of any headline or image of the news article in the news list and clicking on the link will open the page with the news article in a new tab without closing the page with the news application. 
              After the user has already entered a keyword (news topic) in the input field at least once, he can again continue to enter a new keyword in the input field and by pressing the submit button, a new list of headlines and images of news articles on the given news topic will be displayed.
              CSS was used to style, add responsiveness and some animation to the application.
